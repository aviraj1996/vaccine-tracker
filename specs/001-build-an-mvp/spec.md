# Feature Specification: MVP Vaccine Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an MVP vaccine tracking system with three core components that can be tested on a real phone"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A vaccine administrator needs to generate unique QR codes for vaccine doses, have mobile users scan these codes, and view all scan activity in real-time on a central dashboard. The entire workflow must be testable on actual mobile devices connected to the same local network as the development machine.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a vaccine administrator is logged into the QR generator, **When** they enter GTIN, Batch Number, Expiry Date, and Serial Number, **Then** the system displays a live QR code preview and allows downloading the QR image

2. **Given** a QR code has been generated, **When** a mobile user scans it with the mobile app camera, **Then** the system displays the vaccine data with clear labels and saves the scan event

3. **Given** the dashboard is open in a browser, **When** a new scan occurs on the mobile app, **Then** the scan appears instantly in the real-time feed without manual refresh

4. **Given** multiple QR codes have been generated, **When** viewing the dashboard, **Then** the system displays total scan count and recent QR generations in a table format

5. **Given** the mobile app is open, **When** viewing the scanner screen, **Then** the last 5 scans are displayed in a list below the scanner viewfinder

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the mobile device camera cannot read the QR code (damaged, blurry, wrong format)?
- How does the system handle duplicate scans of the same QR code?
- What happens when the mobile app loses network connectivity during a scan?
- How does the dashboard behave when no scans have occurred yet?
- What happens if invalid data is entered in the QR generator fields (e.g., non-numeric GTIN)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**QR Code Generation:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web interface for generating vaccine QR codes
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept input for GTIN, Batch Number, Expiry Date, and Serial Number
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a live QR code preview that updates as the user types
- **FR-004**: System MUST encode QR data in GS1 format: (01)GTIN(10)BATCH(17)EXPIRY(21)SERIAL
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to download generated QR codes as image files
- **FR-006**: System MUST save all generated QR codes to a database for tracking purposes

**Mobile Scanning:**
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a mobile application with login and scanner screens
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable camera-based QR code scanning with a live viewfinder
- **FR-009**: System MUST decode and display scanned vaccine data with clearly labeled fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST show success or error state after each scan attempt
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically save each scan event to the database with timestamp and user information
- **FR-012**: System MUST work on both Android and iOS devices via local network connection
- **FR-013**: System MUST display the last 5 scans in a list on the scanner screen

**Dashboard:**
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a web dashboard showing real-time scan activity
- **FR-015**: System MUST display total number of scans performed
- **FR-016**: System MUST show recent QR code generations in a table
- **FR-017**: System MUST display scan data including timestamp, scanner user, and QR data
- **FR-018**: System MUST automatically refresh and display new scans without manual page reload
- **FR-019**: Dashboard MUST be mobile-responsive for testing on phone browsers

**Authentication & Data:**
- **FR-020**: System MUST authenticate users via email and password
- **FR-021**: System MUST operate as a single-tenant system (one organization only)
- **FR-022**: System MUST use real-time data synchronization across all components

**Workflow:**
- **FR-023**: Complete workflow MUST support: Generate QR on laptop ‚Üí Scan with mobile app ‚Üí View instantly on dashboard
- **FR-024**: All components MUST connect and communicate via a real-time backend service

**MVP Simplifications:**
- **FR-025**: System MUST NOT implement multi-tenancy (single organization only)
- **FR-026**: System MUST NOT require offline support in MVP
- **FR-027**: System MUST NOT implement complex field validations beyond basic format checking
- **FR-028**: System MUST NOT implement role-based access control (all authenticated users have same permissions)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **VaccineQRCode**: Represents a generated QR code containing GTIN (product identifier), Batch Number, Expiry Date, Serial Number, encoded in GS1 format; tracks when and by whom it was created
- **ScanEvent**: Represents a single scan action performed by a mobile user; captures timestamp, which QR code was scanned, which user performed the scan, and the decoded data
- **User**: Represents an authenticated person who can generate QR codes (via web interface) or scan them (via mobile app)
