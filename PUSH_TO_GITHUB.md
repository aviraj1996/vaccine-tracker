## 🔐 Authentication Required

The push failed because Git needs your GitHub credentials. You have **3 options**:

### Option 1: Use GitHub CLI (Recommended - Easiest)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# macOS:
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token (Classic Method)

1. **Generate Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Scopes: Select `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push with Token**:
   ```bash
   # When prompted for password, paste your token
   git push -u origin main

   # Username: aviraj1996
   # Password: <paste your token here>
   ```

3. **Save Credentials** (optional):
   ```bash
   # macOS - use keychain
   git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

   # Then push again - credentials will be saved
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Use SSH (Most Secure - For Future)

1. **Generate SSH Key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # Press Enter to accept default location
   # Press Enter twice for no passphrase (or set one)
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Copy public key to clipboard
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy

   # Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   # Click "New SSH key"
   # Paste key and save
   ```

3. **Change Remote to SSH**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:aviraj1996/vaccine-tracker.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🎯 After Pushing

Once you successfully push, you can:

### 1. Verify on GitHub
Visit: https://github.com/aviraj1996/vaccine-tracker

You should see:
- All your code on the main branch
- Mobile and web directories
- Documentation files
- Proper .gitignore (no .env files visible)

### 2. Start Phase 3.9
From your terminal:
```bash
/implement T074-T079.6
```

This will implement:
- Web API endpoints for mobile integration
- Error handling and CORS
- API testing

### 3. Set Up README
Your repository would benefit from a good README. Consider adding:
- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Architecture overview
- Current status (60% complete)

## 🔒 Security Check

**Environment files are NOT included:**
- ❌ `mobile/.env` - Not pushed (in .gitignore)
- ❌ `web/.env.local` - Not pushed (in .gitignore)
- ✅ `mobile/.env.example` - Pushed (template only)
- ✅ `web/.env.example` - Pushed (template only)

Your Supabase credentials are safe! 🔐

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

**If push still fails:**

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Check if you're on main
git branch

# Try force push (only if you own the repo)
git push -u origin main --force
```

**If you see "repository not found":**
- Check you have access to https://github.com/aviraj1996/vaccine-tracker
- Verify the repository exists on GitHub
- Make sure you're logged in as aviraj1996

1. Choose authentication method (GitHub CLI recommended)
2. Run `git push -u origin main`
3. Start Phase 3.9!
